# Covered
- goroutines, the basic unit of concurrency in Go, which let us check more
than one website at the same time.
- anonymous functions, which we used to start each of the concurrent processes
that check websites.
- channels, to help organize and control the communication between the
different processes, allowing us to avoid a race condition bug.
- the race detector which helped us debug problems with concurrent code
